"""
This program checks whether a given number is prime using a straightforward approach. First, it takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to both input_num and a new variable new_var. It also initializes a counter to zero. The program then enters a while loop that runs as long as new_var is greater than zero. Inside the loop, it checks if input_num is divisible by new_var without leaving a remainder; if true, it increments the counter. After each iteration, new_var is decremented by one to check the next lower number. The loop continues until new_var reaches zero. Once the loop ends, the program evaluates the counter valueâ€”if it is exactly 2, meaning the number has only two divisors (1 and itself), it prints that the number is prime. Otherwise, it prints that the number is not prime.
