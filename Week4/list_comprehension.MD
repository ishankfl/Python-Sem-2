# List Comprehension in Python

List comprehension is a concise and elegant way to create lists in Python. It allows us to generate lists in a single line using a compact syntax, making the code more readable and efficient.

## Problem Statement
Often, we need to create lists by iterating over an existing iterable, applying some transformation, or filtering elements based on a condition. Using traditional loops to accomplish this task can be verbose and less efficient. List comprehension provides a more Pythonic way to achieve this.

### Example Problem:
Generate a list containing the squares of even numbers from 1 to 10.

### Traditional Approach:
```python
even_squares = []
for x in range(1, 11):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        even_squares.append(x**2)
print(even_squares)  # Output: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

### Using List Comprehension:
```python
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)  # Output: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

---

## Basic Syntax
```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```
- **expression**: The operation or transformation to apply to each element.
- **item**: The variable representing each element in the iterable.
- **iterable**: Any iterable object like lists, tuples, strings, etc.
- **condition (optional)**: A filtering criterion that selects elements for inclusion.

## Examples of List Comprehension

### 1. Creating a Simple List
```python
numbers = [x for x in range(5)]
print(numbers)  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### 2. Applying an Expression
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### 3. Using a Condition (Filtering)
```python
even_numbers = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### 4. Using String Operations
```python
words = [word.upper() for word in ['hello', 'world']]
print(words)  # Output: ['HELLO', 'WORLD']
```

### 5. Nested List Comprehension (Flattening a 2D List)
```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
print(flattened)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Advantages of List Comprehension
- **Concise and Readable**: Reduces multiple lines of code to a single line.
- **Performance**: Faster than traditional loops.
- **Less Memory Usage**: Avoids unnecessary use of intermediate variables.

## Conclusion
List comprehension is a powerful feature in Python that enhances code readability and efficiency. It provides an elegant way to create and manipulate lists, making code cleaner and more maintainable. Mastering it will help you write more Pythonic code!
